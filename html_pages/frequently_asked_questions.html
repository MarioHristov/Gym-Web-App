                    <p>Yes. It is neccessary to book a session with a coach before you go to the gym, because the

                    <p>Yes. All activities organized by the gym itself have a person limit so you must book your place
                        before you go to the activity. For events hosted by us or by users there may or may not be a
                        limit, so you must check before you plan on participating. View more information about events <a
